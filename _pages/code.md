### AIGC

- **Summary**
  - [Awesome-Chinese-Stable-Diffusion](https://github.com/leeguandong/Awesome-Chinese-Stable-Diffusion) :Focus on some basic models of Chinese stable diffusion.    
- **LLM**
  - [EcommerceLLM](https://github.com/leeguandong/EcommerceLLM) :E-commerce scene LLM fine-tuned based on qwen1.5 and llama3.     
  - [ECOMCPM](https://github.com/leeguandong/ECOMCPM) :Language model trained on e-commerce data from 'What's Worth Buying' website, a Chinese pretrained model similar to GPT2.    
- **LMM**
  - [XrayLLaVA](https://github.com/leeguandong/XrayLLaVA) :Xray Large Multi-modal Model, fine-tuned on LLaVA for the Xray's multi-modal large model, using 4 V100 GPUs based on the llava1d6-mistral-7b-instruct model. LLaVA is among the most popular model methodologies and architectures in large multi-modal language models. Fine-tuning LLaVA helps us evaluate and compare the potential of training large multi-modal language models in vertical scenarios. 
  - [XrayQwenVL](https://github.com/leeguandong/XrayQwenVL) : Xray Large Multi-modal Model, fine-tuned on QwenVL for Xray's multi-modal large model, using 4 V100 GPUs based on the qwenvl-chat model for fine-tuning.    
- **SD**
  - [HOME-CLIP](https://github.com/leeguandong/HOME-CLIP) :ChineseCLIP model was fine-tuned on home decoration and furniture data crawled from Visual China.      
  - [HOME-DALLE1](https://github.com/leeguandong/HOME-DALLE1) :DALL-E 1 model for Chinese home decoration and furniture scenes.   
  - [controlnet_aux_add](https://github.com/leeguandong/controlnet_aux_add) :Auxiliary functions of ControlNet, an additional library of huggingface's ControlNet aux, adding preprocessors not present in aux.   
- Digital Human
  - [Wav2lipAll](https://github.com/leeguandong/Wav2lipAll) :Training a virtual digital human based on wav2lip, with lip shape driving, including data processing procedures, etc. The model includes sizes 96x96, 192x192, 192x288, 288x288.   
  - [TalkingFace](https://github.com/leeguandong/TalkingFace) :Training set for 2D virtual digital human projects similar to wav2lip, geneface++.

I am currently an Algorithm Engineer at iFlytek, responsible for core algorithm research on projects including [Typemovie](https://typemovie.art), AI Photo Frame, and Super Drawing. Prior to iFlytek, I was a key member of the computer vision algorithm group at Suning, contributing to cutting-edge projects in AIGC and computer vision.

I hold a Master's degree in Surveying and Mapping Engineering from Hefei University of Technology, where my research focused on deep learning for remote sensing image processing, with my [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8784389/) selected for the ESI top 1%. My professional expertise spans AIGC, large language models, diffusion models, video editing, digital humans, OCR, and tamper detection.

I am currently working in the Computer Vision Group of Suning Artificial Intelligence R&D Center. Before joining Suning, I obtained a master's degree in surveying and mapping engineering from Hefei University of Technology. I was an outstanding graduate of Hefei University of Technology and was nominated for an excellent graduation thesis.During my postgraduate studies, I was mainly engaged in research on hyperspectral image classification, remote sensing image detection, and place name recognition. My paper was selected for ESI1%.After work, I mainly engaged in creative class generation (aigc), ocr, tamper detection, multimodal and other work.

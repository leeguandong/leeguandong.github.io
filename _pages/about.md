I am currently an Algorithm Engineer at iFlytek, working in the Consumer Business Group's AI Marketing Business Line, where I focus on developing native applications for large-scale models, particularly the innovative *iFlytek Huijing* project. My work centers on leveraging advanced AI technologies to create impactful solutions for intelligent marketing. Prior to iFlytek, I was a key member of the computer vision algorithm group at Suning, contributing to cutting-edge projects in AI-generated content (AIGC) and computer vision.  

I hold a Master's degree in Surveying and Mapping Engineering from Hefei University of Technology, where I was recognized as an outstanding graduate and my thesis was nominated for an excellent graduation thesis. My academic research focused on hyperspectral remote sensing image classification using deep learning and place name recognition, with my [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8784389/) selected for the ESI top 1%. I also earned a Bachelor's degree from Liaoning Technical University.  

My professional expertise spans AIGC, large language models (LLMs), large vision models (LVMs), video editing, lip-sync-driven 2D digital humans, image synthesis via diffusion models, OCR, and tamper detection. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI to solve real-world challenges.  

**Research Interests:** AIGC, LLMs, LVMs, Video Editing, Digital Humans, Deep Learning, OCR, Detection, Classification, Remote Sensing Image Processing

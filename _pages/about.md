I am currently an Algorithm Engineer at iFlytek, working on developing native applications for large-scale models, particularly the innovative *iFlytek Typemovie* project. Prior to iFlytek, I was a key member of the computer vision algorithm group at Suning, contributing to cutting-edge projects in AIGC and computer vision.

I hold a Master's degree from Hefei University of Technology, where my research on hyperspectral remote sensing image classification was selected for the ESI top 1%. My professional expertise spans AIGC, large language models, diffusion models, video editing, digital humans, OCR, and tamper detection.

I currently work with the algorithm team at Suning, as a key core member of the computer vision algorithm group. Before joining Suning, I received my master's degree in Surveying and Mapping Engineering from Hefei University of Technology and earned my bachelor's degree at Liaoning Technical University. I was an outstanding graduate at HFUT, where my thesis was nominated for an excellent graduation thesis. During my master's program, I primarily engaged in research on hyperspectral remote sensing image classification based on deep learning and place name recognition. My [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8784389/) was selected for the ESI top 1%. Professionally, I am focused on AIGC, which includes e-commerce large language models, multimodal large language models, video editing, lip-sync driven 2D digital humans, image synthesis based on diffusion models, OCR, and tamper detection.

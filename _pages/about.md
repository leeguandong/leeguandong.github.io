[Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=on_b6MMAAAAJ) | [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/u012193416) | [Github](https://github.com/leeguandong) | [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/li-xin-52-81) | [Resume](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DagJaZEQjKnsBRjbkeAEIAA) 

I'm currently a Senior Researcher at [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](http://www.msra.cn/), in a group managed by [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/). Before joining MSRA, I obtained my Ph.D. from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in June, 2019. My doctoral thesis was awarded the excellent Ph.D. thesis of Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2018/04--2018/08, I was a visitor of Prof. [Qiang Yang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~qyang/)'s group at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My work on transfer learning won the best paper awards in ICCSE 2018 and FTL-IJCAI 2019. In 2021, I published the textbook [Introduction to Transfer Learning](http://jd92.wang/tlbook), a hands-on introduction to transfer learning. In 2022, I was selected as one of the [2022 AI 2000 Most Influential Scholars](https://www.aminer.cn/ai2000?domain_ids=5dc122672ebaa6faa962c2a4) by AMiner between 2012-2021 (ranked 49/2000). Four of my first-author papers are ranked by Google Scholar as [highly-cited papers](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/421192644). I gave tutorials at [IJCAI'22](https://dgresearch.github.io/).

**Research interest:** RS Image Processing,Deep Learning,OCR,Creative Generation


#### Highlights

1. Four of my papers are highly cited and ranked top 20 globally in recent 5 years in Google scholar metrics! See [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/421192644).
2. I wrote a popular book [迁移学习导论](http://jd92.wang/tlbook) to make it easy to learn, understand, and use transfer learning.
3. I lead the most popular transfer learning and semi-supervised learning projects on Github: [Transfer learning repo](https://github/jindongwang/transferlearning) [![Transfer learning repo](/assets/img/transferlearning-repo-star.jpg)](https://github/jindongwang/transferlearning) and  [Semi-supervised learning repo](https://github/torchssl/torchssl) [![SSL repo](/assets/img/torchssl-star.jpg)](https://github/stars/torchssl/torchssl)
